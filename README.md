# Physics_JS
Physics_JS is a learning platform for kids. It is a JS port of sugarlabs physics activity.It provides a physical world simulator and playground -- you can add squares, circles, triangles, or draw your own shapes, and see them come to life with forces (think gravity, Newton!), friction (scrrrrape), and inertia (ahh, slow down!).

**Following are my current ideas for Physics_JS:** <br>
<code>
<p>Playground:Basic physics playground that provides user create,write,draw features. </p>
<p>Lab:Various Experiments of physics that user can analyse & relate with physics sciences. </p>
<p>Project:This will have various tools to create a physics project, e.g Design a dancing doll etc. This section will basically aim at creating simulations.</p>
<p>Quiz: Based on a given physics,kids can take quiz to strengthen his concepts.</p>
<p>Art: An interactive drwaing tools where user will get facility to draw objects & then add physics to it viz. mass,velocity,dimensions,accelaration,drop,drag,gravity,friction,oscillation etc.</p>
<p>Academics:Kids can search their physics courses/chapters in Physics_JS. </p>

**Ideas that has to be tried as part of implementation details**  <br>
<p>Build a catapult to simulate Angry Birds </p>
<p>Build a machine that sorts different sized balls in to two buckets, large and small, with no ball jams.</p>
<p>A cyclic mechanism for lifting balls from the bottom of the screen to the top, again and again.</p>
<p>Try dropping 2 different mass objects at the same time. </p>
<p>Experiment with pendulums of different lengths and masses.</p>
<p>Ping pong, can you make a device that hits a ball back and forth across the screen? </p>
<p>Try building a mechanical binary clock. </p>
<p>Convert rotation into parallel motion using pistons.</p>
<p>Experiment with touching one motorised circle against one pinned circle of various sizes.</p>
<p>Try building a rag-doll puppet and make it dance in a convincing way.</p>
<p>Use just links and circles to make a structurally sound Eiffel Tower.</p>
<p>Try building a ratchet mechanism.</p>
<p>Try building an analogue clock face where the min hand goes around 60 times for each hour.<p>
